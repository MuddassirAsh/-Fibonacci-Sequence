# Fibonacci Sequence Calculator

The Fibonacci sequence is one of the most famous formulas in mathematics.

Each number in the sequence is the sum of the two numbers that precede it. So, the sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.

The user is prompted to enter the number of fibonacci numbers they wish to calculate. The program then calculates the lists and prints it out.
